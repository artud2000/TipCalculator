## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I'm not an expert yet in AutoLayout so that caused me some issues, also dealing with the currency was a bit troublesome I could have done it easily in Objective-C but as Swift 3 is new for me I struggled a bit. I also faced some difficulties with the some of the classes initializer methods some of them were requiring me a different type of parameter in the initializer in order to instantiate an object from the desired class.
